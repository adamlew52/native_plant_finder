Explanation:
1. The backend is implemented using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python.
2. The frontend consists of two HTML templates: index.html for the homepage and plants.html for displaying native plants.
3. When the user submits their location on the homepage, the form data is sent to the /plants route via a POST request.
4. The backend retrieves the native plants data based on the user's location and renders the plants.html template to display the list of native plants.
5. This is a simplified example and doesn't include actual data retrieval based on the user's location. In a real-world scenario, you would likely use geolocation services or integrate with a database of native plants.
